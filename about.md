I code. I art. I music. I am.

Fascinated with concurrent/parallel programming.

Locks, Eventual Consistency, Snapshots, etc..

OOP of FP, whatever fits the bill for the job.

Recently getting into game development. What a wonderfully different world than the web.

Here is my website if you want to find more social links about me: [selfup](https://selfup.me)
